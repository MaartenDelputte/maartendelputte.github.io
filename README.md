# Delputte Maarten website
This is the code of my current website.

## SASS
The SASS structure is based on ITCSS. This helps developers to have a nice and helpfull structure to easily make changes to the styling.

## JS
I try to tuse as much vanilla JS as possible unless there is a great library out there that is small and get's the job done. JS is bundled with all the assets by webpack. I try to avoid jQuery when possible.
